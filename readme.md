# Basic Openlayers + Vite package for Fobney Meadows

I've taken code examples and written code around them to create a small
webapp to allow people to add features to a map that was created for a local
nature reserve.

This would allow people to track e.g. Himalayan Balsam or add extra
footpaths/permitted paths etc.
